Your task is to analyze a provided list of unique codes along with a QEC (Quote-Explanation-Code) data, and then generate higher-level themes based on this information. 
These themes should be directly linked to the Main topic and research questions.

Context:
1. **List of Unique Codes:**  
   A separate list containing all the unique codes extracted from the QEC data.

   Codes:
    {unique_codes}

2. **QEC Data (JSON):**
  The Code and summary table contains the rationale summary (summary), and the assigned code.

     ```

   Data:
   {qec_table}

Step-by-Step Process Guidance:
### Analytical Assumptions and Considerations

- **Dual Processes of Quality Analysis:**  
  Good quality codes and themes result from both immersive, in-depth engagement with the dataset and from giving the developing analysis some reflective distance—often achieved by taking breaks during the process.

- **Nature of Themes:**  
  Themes are patterns anchored by a shared idea, meaning, or concept. They are not comprehensive summaries of every aspect of a topic, but rather analytic outputs that capture significant and coherent patterns in the data.

- **Emergent Analytic Outputs:**  
  Both codes and themes are analytic outputs that are produced through systematic engagement with the data. They cannot be fully identified ahead of the analysis; instead, they are actively constructed by the researcher.

- **Active Production:**  
  Themes do not passively 'emerge' from the data; they are the result of deliberate, reflective, and systematic analysis, combining both immediate engagement and thoughtful analysis.

### Instructions

1. **Familiarization with the Data:**
   - Review the list of unique codes to understand the overall coding scheme.
   - Examine the QEC data for each code, considering both the explicit (semantic) content and the underlying (latent) meanings conveyed by the associated quotes and explanations.

2. **Theme Generation:**
   - Identify patterns and shared meanings among the codes by referring to the context provided by the quotes and explanations.
   - Actively construct higher-level themes from the codes. Remember, these themes are analytic outputs produced through both immersion in the data and reflective distancing.
   - Group related codes into themes that capture significant, coherent patterns without attempting to summarize every detail of the topic.

3. **Theme Refinement:**
   - Merge overlapping themes and separate those that conflate multiple distinct ideas.
   - Validate the coherence of each theme against the detailed context provided by the associated quotes and explanations.

4. **Theme Naming:**
   - Assign concise, evocative names to each theme that accurately reflect the central ideas of the grouped codes.

**Output Format and Constraints:**
   - Provide your final output strictly in valid JSON format without any additional commentary.
   - The JSON structure should be as follows:

   ```json

   Since codes can be subjective, think a lot before answering if your answer would make more sense or switching to the user's comment would be better.
3. Provide a concise explanation of your assessment and indicate if the code/quote requires revision.
4. Select the appropriate command:
   - Use REMOVE_QUOTE if the code/quote is inappropriate.
   - Use ACCEPT_QUOTE if the code/quote is appropriate.
   - Use EDIT_QUOTE if you believe the code/quote should be modified. In this case, include a list of alternative code suggestions.
   - Use REVERT_TO_INITIAL if you believe that the initial code is more suitable than the current one or the user specifically requests it to be reverted.
   
### Output Requirements
Return your output strictly in valid JSON format:
```json
{{
  "agreement": "AGREE" or "DISAGREE",
  "explanation": "Your explanation text here",
  "command": "REMOVE_QUOTE" or "ACCEPT_QUOTE" or "EDIT_QUOTE" or "REVERT_TO_INITIAL",

You are an expert in qualitative research, specializing in Braun & Clarke's six-phase thematic analysis. 

Your task is to follow instructions to group the provided codes into higher-level codes based on the associated QEC (Quote-Explanation-Code) data. 
These higher-level codes should be directly linked to the Main topic and research questions.


Context:
Code and summary Data: 
```json
{qec_table}
```
Unique Codes:
```json
{codes}
```

Step-by-Step Process Guidance:
- Assess the provisional groupings for coherence and fit with the data.
- Check if each emerging higher-level code tells a convincing story about the dataset.
- Determine whether any candidate codes should be merged, split, or discarded.
 
- Fine-tune and finalize higher-level codes so each has a clear central concept.
- Write a concise definition capturing the essence of each grouping.
- Ensure the groupings form a coherent overall story about the data.

Your tasks:
1. **Review the Code and summary Data**:  
   - The Code and summary table contains the rationale summary (summary), and the assigned code.
   - Example structure in JSON:
     ```json
     [
        {{
          "code": "CodeName",
          "summary": "Summary of multiple explanations signifying the meaning of the code."
        }}
        // Additional instances...
      ]
     ```
    
2. **Examine the List of Unique Codes**:  
   - This is a simple array of code names extracted from the Code and summary table, e.g.:
     ```json
     ["Code1", "Code2", "Code3", ...]
     ```
   - These are the existing lower-level codes that may need to be merged or refined into broader categories.

3. **Develop Higher-Level Codes**:  
   - Group related lower-level codes under more encompassing, conceptual headings.
   - Name each higher-level code in a succinct, meaningful way.

4. **Check for Fit and Coherence**:  
   - For each higher-level code, confirm it is consistent with the original summary.
   - If any code doesn't fit or contradicts the grouping, consider re-grouping it.
   - Be prepared to revise (split, merge, rename) during this review.

5. **Ensure Distinctness**:  
   - Make sure each higher-level code is meaningfully different from the others.
   - Avoid overlapping definitions or repeated coverage of the same pattern.

6. **Finalize Output**:  
   - Return the result in **valid JSON** only, following the same structure given below.
   - Do **not** include any text outside the JSON object.

Output Format and Constraints
```json
{{
  "higher_level_codes": [
    {{

        "RelevantLowerLevelCodeD"
      ]
    }}

```

**Important**:
- Provide clear, compelling names for each higher-level code.
- Each higher-level code should have a concise definition that captures the essence of the grouping.
- Each lower-level code should be included in only one higher-level code, and try to group as many codes as possible.
- Return **only** this JSON object, with no extra commentary or text outside of it.

The definition should be concise, clear, and representative of the various perspectives presented. If there are contradictions, acknowledge them in the definition or provide a definition that encompasses the different viewpoints. Aim for definitions that are approximately a few sentences long, but ensure they are comprehensive enough to cover the main points.

Do not simply select one explanation as the definition; instead, create a new definition that integrates the key elements from all explanations for each code.

Output Format and Constraints:
Present your results in a JSON object where each key is a code and each value is the corresponding definition. The format should be:
```json
{{
  "code1": "definition1",
  "code2": "definition2",
  ...
}}
```

Your response should consist solely of the JSON object containing the definitions for each code. Do not include any additional text, explanations, or commentary.

You are an expert in qualitative research, tasked with refining code definitions based on previous outputs and feedback. 

Previously, you generated definitions for various codes by summarizing multiple explanations. 
Now, you will refine those definitions using feedback and by re-examining the original explanations.

Context:
1. **Previous Codebook:**  
   The definitions generated in the previous run, which the user did not prefer so wants them to be changed and need to keep in mind to avoid while generating a new version, provided in JSON format:

   {previous_codebook}

2. **Feedback:**  
   Feedback on the previous codebook to guide refinement:

   {feedback}

3. **Original Explanations (JSON):**  
   The original data containing codes and their explanations, structured as follows:
   ```json
   {{
     "code1": ["Explanation1", "Explanation2", ...],
     "code2": ["Explanation1", "Explanation2", ...],
     ...
   }}
   ```
   The input JSON object is:

   {codes}

Step-by-Step Process Guidance:
1. **Review the Previous Codebook and Feedback:**  
   - Examine the previous definitions and the feedback provided.  
   - Identify specific areas where the definitions can be improved based on the feedback.  
   - If the feedback indicates that a definition is already satisfactory, you may keep it as is or make minor adjustments as needed.

2. **Re-examine the Original Explanations:**  
   - Review the original explanations for each code to ensure the refined definitions capture the common themes, key points, and any notable differences or contradictions.

3. **Refine the Definitions:**  
   - For each code, refine the definition by addressing the feedback while maintaining the essence of the original definition where appropriate.  
   - Ensure that the refined definition remains grounded in the original explanations, integrating their key elements while addressing the feedback.  
   - The refined definition should be concise (a few sentences), clear, and representative of the various perspectives in the explanations.  
   - If there are contradictions in the explanations, acknowledge them or provide a definition that encompasses the different viewpoints.  
   - Do not simply select one explanation as the definition; instead, create a new definition that integrates the key elements from all explanations, refined based on the feedback.

Output Format and Constraints:
   - Provide the refined definitions in a JSON object where each key is a code and each value is the corresponding refined definition.  
   - The format should be:

   ```json
   {{
     "code1": "refined_definition1",
     "code2": "refined_definition2",
     ...
   }}
   ```

Your response should consist solely of the JSON object containing the refined definitions for each code. Do not include any additional text, explanations, or commentary.

You are an expert in qualitative research, specializing in Braun & Clarke's six-phase thematic analysis.  

Your task is to review the list of initial codes and merge any that share the same meaning into a single, more abstract code. Aim for a balanced set of clusters—neither too many highly granular codes nor too few overly broad ones. Use concise, descriptive names that capture the essence of each group.
 
Context:
Codes to cluster (JSON array of strings):
{words_json}

Step-by-Step Process Guidance:
Generate each cluster code (reviewed code) as a natural phrase - just as a expert human qualitative researcher would. Each word in the code should be seperated by a space.

Output Format and Constraints:
Return **only** valid JSON (no extra text), wrapped in a markdown code block, in this format:
