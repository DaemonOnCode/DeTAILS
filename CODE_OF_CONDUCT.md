# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers of `DeTAILS` pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability status, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form
- Violent or threatening language or imagery
- Public or private harassment
- Personal insults, especially those using racist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary language
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, or deliberately disruptive behavior
- Publishing others’ private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for:

- Clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior
- Enforcing the Code of Conduct through appropriate, fair, and consistent corrective action
- Responding to reports of unacceptable behavior in a timely and empathetic manner

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing our project or community include using an official project e‑mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All reports will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
